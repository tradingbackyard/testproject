# test project

Here's what I need:
1. user can upload a CSV to browser (You can pull CSV from here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tradingbackyard/historicaldata/master/AUDCAD_D_BID.csv 
or https://github.com/tradingbackyard/historicaldata)
2. CSV is parse into an array of rows (high, low, open, close, date/time)
3. Then we have a function that draw each data element as a candlestick 
4. We can change the color of candle sticks from variables set
5. We can drag to scale X axis which compress graph
6. We can drag to scale Y axis which compress graph
7. If we click a button, we can drag the chart around to move to another location
8. We can draw lines and shapes on canvas
9. We can draw technical indicator on top of graph(plot math function on graph)
